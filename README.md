# liri-node-app
In this assignment, we were asked to make a LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Used with bandsintown APIs, Spotify and OMDB APIs.

Made so liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

node liri.js spotify-this-song - Displays various Data about Song inputed as well as a 30 second clip.
Artist(s) name, The song's name, A preview link of the song from Spotify, and The album that the song is from.

node liri.js concert-this - Displays Name of the venue, Venue location, and Date of the Event.

node liri.js movie-this - Displays various Data about any inputed Movie.

node liri.js do-what-it-says - fs.readFile command taking text from text file and using it on Terminal Window.
